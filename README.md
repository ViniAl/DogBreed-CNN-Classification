# DogBreed-CNN-Classification
This repo implements a CNN model to identify different dog breeds from image using the Stanford Dogs dataset available at: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/main.html

This code was developed using various resources from the web, courses and it was submitted as proof of work and knowledge share for the specialization course in Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence for PUC-MINAS

The project aims to explore some of nuances of image pre-processing in data preparation, model implementation using tensorflow/keras as well some auxiliary steps using sklearn library. The contents of this repository are definitely beginner level in the AI field and want to showcase a range of different steps in an full implementation of a model for an specific problem.
